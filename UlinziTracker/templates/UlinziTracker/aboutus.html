  <h2>About the Developer</h2>
  <h3><strong>UlinziTracker</strong> is a community safety platform developed and customized by <strong>Philip</strong>.</h3>
  <p style="max-width: 700px; text-align: center;">
    This project was built using <a href="https://www.djangoproject.com/">Django</a> and reflects a personal commitment to empowering communities through technology. UlinziTracker enables real-time incident reporting, secure communication, and data-driven decision-making for safer neighborhoods.
    <br><br>
    Every feature — from role-based access to incident analytics — was thoughtfully designed to bridge the gap between residents and security services. This is a hands-on, purpose-driven solution created with scalability, simplicity, and impact in mind.
